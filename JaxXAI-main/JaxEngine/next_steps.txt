Apps & Experiences
- Marketing site (`/`): hero, features, contact form, pricing and CTA flow.
- Dashboard suite (`/dashboard` and subroutes): module-toggled widgets, live signals calculator, scouting, admin tools.
- Control Room (`/YOLO` & `/YOLO/connect-demo`): Firebase-authenticated trading cockpit with OKX integrations.
- HeyJax conversational assistant (`/HeyJax`): AI chat and research pipelines.
- Automation add-ons (`/jaxbot` — module located at `modules/jaxbot`, `/dashboard/alerts`, API endpoints under `/api/*`, including prices, strategies, compliance, voice, vision).

Recommended Next Steps
1. Configure production environment variables on Vercel for OpenAI, Stripe, Firebase, OKX, LunarCrush, and any new API keys introduced by the merged features.
2. Remove the unsupported `eslint` flag from `next.config.mjs`, pick a single lockfile strategy, and rerun `npm run build` to ensure a clean CI build.
3. Push the merged branch, trigger a Vercel preview deployment, and smoke test key routes (`/`, `/dashboard`, `/YOLO`, `/HeyJax`, `/api/prices/live`) with live credentials.
4. After verification, promote the preview to production and monitor logs for rate-limit or env-var warnings during the first run.
