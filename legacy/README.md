# Legacy Assets

This directory collects historical experiments and archived deliverables that are not part of the active build system. Nothing in here is required for the current `jaxxai-crypto-dashboard` Vite app or the `JaxEngine` core, but the assets remain available for reference.

- `JaxRun/` – earlier prototype of the automation suite, preserved for design reference.
- `jax-last-trade/` & related archives – legacy trading experiment snapshots.
- `Jax-OKX.zip` – packaged assets from the original OKX integration proof of concept.
- `openai-cookbook/` – miscellaneous research snippets copied from OpenAI samples.

Feel free to delete items in this folder once they have been migrated or are no longer needed.
